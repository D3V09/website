                The history of RAM is closely intertwined with the evolution of computer technology. Here's a
                detailed overview of how RAM have evolved over time:
                <li><b><u>Early Magnetic Core Memory (1940s-1950s)</u></b> :-
                    <p>
                        Early computers used magnetic core memory, which consisted of tiny ferrite rings threaded with
                        wires. Information was stored as the presence or absence of magnetic charges in these cores.
                        <br><br>
                        This memory was non-volatile, but it was relatively slow and consumed a significant amount of
                        power.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b><u>Transistor-Based RAM (Late 1950s-1960s)</u></b> :-
                    <p>
                        - The invention of the transistor led to the development of transistor-based RAM. <br><br>
                        - Transistors acted as switches to store binary data (0s and 1s) as electrical charges in capacitors. <br><br>
                        - These early transistor-based RAM technologies included magnetic-core RAM, magnetic-bubble RAM, and thin-film memory.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><u>Dynamic RAM (DRAM) Emergence (1970s)</u></b> :-
                    <p>
                        - The development of Dynamic RAM (DRAM) marked a significant advancement in memory technology. <br><br>
                        - DRAM stored each bit of data as a charge in a capacitor within an integrated circuit.
                        <br><br>
                        - DRAM was faster and more compact compared to earlier technologies, but it required constant refreshing to retain data.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                        - Static RAM (SRAM) was developed as an alternative to DRAM. <br><br>
                        - SRAM used flip-flop circuits to store data, making it faster and more reliable than DRAM. <br><br>
                        - However, SRAM was more expensive and consumed more power than DRAM.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                Random Access Memory (RAM) is a type of volatile computer memory that plays a pivotal role in the rapid execution of programs and tasks on a computer system. Unlike other forms of storage, such as hard drives or solid-state drives, RAM enables swift data access without the need for sequential reading, providing quick retrieval and modification capabilities.
                <br><br>
                RAM serves as a temporary workspace where data, instructions, and applications are loaded when the computer is in use. It stores data in electronic circuits, organized into cells, each with a unique address. This arrangement allows the CPU to access any cell directly, irrespective of the order in which the data was stored, hence the term "random access."
                <br><br>
                As a fast and short-term storage medium, RAM enables seamless multitasking, smoother application execution, and efficient interaction between the CPU and other system components. However, its volatile nature means that it requires a continuous power supply to retain data. When the computer is turned off or restarted, the data stored in RAM is erased.

            <p class="in">
                1. <b>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</b> :- <br>
                This type of RAM is commonly used in computers. It stores each bit of data as a charge within a capacitor. DRAM requires periodic refreshing to maintain the charge, which makes it less power-efficient but more cost-effective for high-capacity memory.
                <br><br>
                2. <b>Static RAM (SRAM)</b> :- <br>
                SRAM is faster and more reliable than DRAM, as it stores data using flip-flop circuits. It doesn't require constant refreshing, but it's more expensive and is often used for cache memory within the CPU.
                <br><br>
                3. <b>Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM)</b> :- <br>
                SDRAM synchronizes its operations with the system clock, offering improved performance over traditional DRAM. It's widely used in personal computers and workstations.
                <br><br>
                4. <b>DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate SDRAM)</b> :- <br>
                This is a type of SDRAM that transfers data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock cycle. DDR, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5 are successive generations of this memory, with each version providing increased data transfer rates and efficiency
