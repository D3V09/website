            <p>
                A Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the primary component of a computer system responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It functions as the "brain" of the computer, coordinating and controlling various tasks. The CPU interprets instructions from the computer's memory and carries out arithmetic, logical, control, and input/output operations.
                <br><br>
                Modern CPUs are composed of multiple cores, each capable of executing instructions independently, thus enabling parallel processing and improved performance. The CPU's key components include the Control Unit, which manages the execution of instructions; the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), responsible for mathematical and logical operations; and the Register File, which temporarily holds data and instructions.
                <br><br>
                The CPU's clock speed, measured in gigahertz (GHz), determines how many instructions it can process per second. However, higher clock speeds don't always directly translate to better performance due to factors like architectural design and efficiency.
                <br><br>
                CPUs support various instruction sets, which are standardized commands that software programs use to communicate with the hardware. Common instruction sets include x86, used by most PCs, and ARM, prevalent in mobile devices.

        <button class="tp_box"><strong>Components of CPU</strong></button>
        <div class="para2">
            <p class="in">
                1. <b>Control Unit (CU)</b> :-  <br>
                This part of the CPU manages the execution of instructions. It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them to understand what needs to be done, and then coordinates the necessary actions within the CPU.
                <br><br>
                2. <b>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</b> :- <br>
                The ALU is responsible for performing arithmetic calculations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and logical operations (such as AND, OR, NOT) as required by the instructions.
                <br><br>
                3. <b>Registers</b> :-<br> 
                These are small, fast storage areas within the CPU that hold data temporarily while the CPU processes it. Registers are used to store operands, intermediate results, and addresses of memory locations.
                <br><br>
                4. <b>Clock</b> :-<br> 
                The CPU operates based on a clock signal, which synchronizes the various components of the CPU and ensures that instructions are executed in the correct sequence. The clock speed, measured in Hertz (Hz) or gigahertz (GHz), determines how many instructions the CPU can execute per unit of time.
                <br><br>
                5. <b>Cache Memory</b> :- <br>
                CPUs often have multiple levels of cache memory, which are small, high-speed memory banks used to store frequently accessed data and instructions. Cache memory helps reduce the time the CPU spends waiting for data to be fetched from slower main memory (RAM).
                <br><br>
                6. <b>Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)</b> :-<br> 
                This defines the set of instructions that the CPU can execute. Different CPUs may have different ISAs, and software needs to be compatible with the CPU's ISA to run properly.
                <br><br>
                7. <b>Pipelining</b> :-<br> 
                Modern CPUs use a technique called pipelining to increase efficiency. Pipelining breaks down instruction execution into stages, with each stage handled by a separate unit of the CPU. This allows multiple instructions to be in different stages of execution simultaneously.

                8. <b>Multiple Cores</b> :-<br> 
                Many modern CPUs have multiple cores, which are essentially separate processing units within a single physical CPU chip. Multi-core CPUs can execute multiple tasks or threads concurrently, improving overall performance.
                <br><br>
                9. <b>Microarchitecture</b> :- <br>
                The internal design and organization of a CPU are known as its microarchitecture. Different CPUs from different manufacturers may have distinct microarchitectures that affect their performance and capabilities.
