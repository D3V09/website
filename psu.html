                steady supply. Voltage regulators ensure that the output voltages remain within specified limits,
                preventing overvoltage or undervoltage situations.
                <br><br>
                The PSU provides different output voltages, such as +12V, +5V, and +3.3V, tailored to meet the
                requirements of various computer components like the motherboard, graphics card, storage drives, and
                peripherals. The wattage rating of a PSU indicates the maximum power it can deliver, accommodating the
                power demands of all connected devices.
                <br><br>
                A high-quality PSU is crucial for system stability, efficiency, and protection against power surges or
                fluctuations. It also contributes to the overall reliability and performance of the computer by ensuring
                consistent and clean power delivery to all internal components.
