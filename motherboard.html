                The history of motherboards is closely intertwined with the evolution of computer technology. Here's a
                detailed overview of how motherboards have evolved over time:
                <li><b><u>1950s - 1960s</u></b> :-
                    <p>
                        Early computers didn't have the concept of a motherboard as we know
                        it today. Instead, they used individual discrete components soldered onto circuit boards. These
                        early machines were large and complex, with limited functionality compared to modern computers.
                    </p>

                interaction between these components. This is achieved through an elaborate network of traces and
                pathways etched onto the motherboard's surface, which allows electrical signals and data to flow between
                different elements of the computer system. The motherboard also contains a chipset, encompassing
                northbridge and southbridge components, which governs data flow, control signals, and power distribution
                across the system.
                <br><br>
                Integral to the motherboard is the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), a firmware embedded within a
                dedicated chip. The BIOS initializes the system during boot-up, conducting essential system checks and
                configurations that enable the operating system to take over. Additionally, the motherboard boasts an
                array of connectors and ports, enabling seamless integration with external devices like USB peripherals,
                audio devices, networking cables, and display monitors.
